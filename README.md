Title: Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, and Selection Sort
## Sorting Algorithms
### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is fully sorted.

The algorithm's name comes from the behavior of larger elements "bubbling" to the end of the list during each iteration. Bubble Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient for large datasets.

### 2. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is another comparison-based sorting algorithm. It starts with a sorted subarray and iteratively "inserts" each element from the unsorted part into its correct position within the sorted subarray.

This algorithm is efficient for small arrays or partially sorted arrays. The average and worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is also O(n^2), and it performs better than Bubble Sort.

### 3. Selection Sort
Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted array and placing it at the beginning. It maintains two subarrays: the sorted subarray on the left and the unsorted subarray on the right.

Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), regardless of the input's distribution. It performs similarly to Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort for small datasets but is not as efficient for larger datasets.
